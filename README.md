# Introduction
This is the repo for the group learning about Natural Language Processing.

## Description
This project aims to capture major decade trends that occur
in New York Times article titles. This will be accomplished
by pulling article titles from the NYT Archives API and 
performing text analysis. The goal is to find words that
are important for a given decade relative to all other 
decades. The important concepts from a decade will be 
visualized using word clouds. This project will be built
using python with the nltk and wordcloud libraries.

# Analysis

* recessions vs expansion periods: what are significant words for each across all 150 years?
* recessions through the years: what makes each 50-year period of recessions unique?
* expansions through the years: what makes each 50-year period of expansions unique?
